Description
-----------

SeqTweet is a library that lets you store arbitrary-length strings on Twitter by implementing [singly linked lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#Singly.2C_doubly.2C_and_multiply_linked_lists) of Tweets. It builds the lists using Twitter's native properties (e.g., an [@reply](https://support.twitter.com/entries/14023-what-are-replies-and-mentions) is used to point from one list element to the next). Lists built with SeqTweet respond to [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)-type requests.

The library itself can safely transform strings of any type. (It will chop up an undelimited string into the correct Tweet-sized components, for example.) Because Twitter strips all leading- and trailing-edge whitespace, and replaces multiple spaces with single characters, writing and then reading an undelimited string will not yield the same result. For this reason, any strings you store with SeqTweet should be delimited by single spaces.

Testing & Usage
---------------

1. Select a Twitter account to use for testing, and [set up an API application](https://dev.twitter.com/apps) with read and write permissions. Note the OAuth consumer key and secret.

2. Install SeqTweet from [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/SeqTweet). If you have [```pip```](http://guide.python-distribute.org/installation.html) installed, you can type:

        $ sudo pip install seqtweet

3. Run the ```auth.py``` script that comes with SeqTweet, and enter the two OAuth values.

4. Authorize the PIN by following the URL, and the copy the OAuth access key and secret.

5. Now record all four values into the ```creds.py``` script that comes with SeqTweet.

6. At this point you can run SeqTweet from the command line and follow its CRUD tests.

7. To use the SeqTweet library with your own scripts, simply import the object:

        from seqtwee.seqtweet import SeqTweet

8. And then instantiate a SeqTweet object using the appropriate OAuth values, which gives you access to the CRUD functions.
